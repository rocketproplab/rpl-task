# RPL Task Library

## Information for running tests

Need to install google test + cmake to run tests. Follow guide from here [Google Test Guide](http://google.github.io/googletest/) to install google test.

To actually run the test use the Makefile and use make clean in between tests.

# Refactor the things

- [X] Teach structure of the project + how it works
- [ ] Remove cmake/find better testing lib
- [ ] change names to be snake-case
- [ ] change file names to be new standard
- [ ] more documentation
